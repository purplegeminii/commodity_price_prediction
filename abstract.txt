TITLE: Analyzing and Forecasting Cocoa, Gold, and Oil Prices for Economic Stability in Ghana

AUTHOR: Delali Kwesi Kumi Nsiah-Asare


Ghanaâ€™s economic resilience is intricately tied to the global prices of cocoa, gold, and oil commodities that are highly vulnerable to external shocks and market volatility. Accurate forecasting of these prices is vital for enabling policymakers to design proactive fiscal strategies, stabilize national revenue, and safeguard economic growth.
This study integrates traditional econometric methods (ARIMA, SARIMA) and advanced machine learning approaches (Long Short-Term Memory networks and AutoML-based Transformers) to forecast the prices of cocoa, gold, and oil over a historical period from 1980 to 2024. Data were sourced from the Bank of Ghana and World Bank, with preprocessing steps including interpolation, stationarity testing (ADF, KPSS), seasonality detection (Kruskal-Wallis test), and normalization. Model performance was evaluated through MAE, RMSE, and MAPE metrics, ensuring robust comparisons between models.
The results revealed that deep learning models, particularly LSTM networks, consistently outperformed traditional econometric models in capturing nonlinear temporal dependencies, commodity interdependencies, and seasonal patterns. Notably, LSTM models demonstrated superior forecasting accuracy across all commodities, with significant improvements over ARIMA and SARIMA baselines. AutoML models offered additional promise, particularly for operationalizing forecasting pipelines.
The findings highlight the transformative potential of machine learning for commodity price forecasting in Ghana. By adopting advanced predictive models, policymakers can enhance fiscal planning, anticipate market shocks, and design more resilient economic strategies. Future work should focus on extensive hyperparameter tuning, developing hybrid models, incorporating real-time data streams, and addressing external shocks like geopolitical events and climate risks to further bolster economic forecasting capabilities.
